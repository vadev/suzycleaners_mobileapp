A concierge garment-care app for **Suzy's Cleaners** in Burbank, CA (est. 1996).
It runs on iOS and Android from one Expo / React Native codebase.

## Features

  current-order card, trust badges, service tiles, Chamber Member
  recognition, and **Coming Soon: Pasadena & Northridge**.
- **Services:** Dry Cleaning, Garment Care, Luxury Shoe Cleaning, Tailoring &
  Alterations, and Pickup & Delivery, each with its own detail page.
- **Schedule a Pickup:**
  - Choose services and quantities.
  - Pick a pickup and a delivery address (saved to the profile).
  - Pick a date and time window, and add special instructions (500 characters).
  - See a live estimate. The **$50 minimum** is enforced.
  - The service radius is checked (default 20 miles, set by staff).
- **Orders:** live status tracker with Request Received → Pickup Confirmed →
  Driver on the Way → Picked Up → Cleaning in Progress → Ready for
  Pickup / Ready for Delivery → Out for Delivery → Completed, plus Cancelled.

  system notifications.

**Staff (Admin)**
- **Hidden staff login:**
  - Long-press the version label at the bottom of **Account**, or open
    `suzyscleaners://staff-login`.
  - It never appears as a customer option.
  - It locks for one minute after 5 failed attempts.
- **Admin Dashboard:**
  - Counts for New, Scheduled, In Cleaning, Ready, Messages, Active,
    Completed and Cancelled.
  - Customer and order search.
  - Select an order, then use **Update & Notify Customer**.
- **Order detail:**
  - Customer name, phone, email, pickup and delivery addresses, requested
    date and time window, services, instructions, estimated and final total,
    status history.
  - **Update & Notify Customer** sends an editable message. Ready for Pickup
    sends "Great news! Your Suzy Cleaners order is ready for pickup."
- **Customers:** profiles, contact info, saved addresses, order history,
  message history.
- **Messages:** inbox with unread counts, conversation history, replies,
  quick replies, and custom messages to any customer.
- **Settings:**
  - Services, descriptions and pricing.
  - $50 minimum and service radius.
  - Time windows and business hours.
  - Current and Coming Soon locations.
  - The notification text for each status.
  - Business profile, and a demo-data reset.

**Role-based access:** sessions carry a role.
- Customers can't sign in through the staff screen, and staff can't sign in
  as customers.
- `/admin/*` routes redirect anyone who isn't an admin.
- With Supabase, the database enforces this: row-level security plus
  role-checked server functions (see [docs/BACKEND.md](docs/BACKEND.md)). The
  local demo adapter applies the same checks on the device.

## Data: Supabase or on-device demo

- **Supabase (production):** copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add your
  project URL and anon key. The app switches to Supabase automatically. Setup
  takes about 10 minutes: [docs/BACKEND.md](docs/BACKEND.md).
- **On-device demo:** with no Supabase keys, the app runs on sample data
  stored on the phone, using the accounts below.

## Demo accounts (on-device demo only)

| Role     | Email                     | Password         |
|----------|---------------------------|------------------|
| Admin    | admin@suzyscleaners.com   | SuzyAdmin2026!   |
| Customer | demo@suzyscleaners.com    | Demo1234!        |

Customers can also create their own account. Passwords are stored only as
salted SHA-256 hashes, and the session token lives in the iOS Keychain /
Android Keystore (`expo-secure-store`).

> The demo backend stores data **on the device**. To try the full loop on one
> phone, book as the customer, sign out, sign in as staff, update the order,
> then sign back in as the customer. With Supabase, the customer and staff can
> use separate phones and updates arrive live.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npx expo start          # press i for iOS simulator, a for Android, or scan with Expo Go
npm run typecheck
```

You need a development build (`npx expo run:ios|android` or
`npx eas-cli build --profile development`) for remote push notifications. Run
`npx eas-cli init` first so the EAS project id is filled in.

## Brand

- **Palette:** Suzy's navy and royal blue from the logo, a warm orange call
  to action, sunshine yellow from the approved mockups, plus cream, beige and
  muted gold for the luxury feel. Tokens live in `src/theme/index.ts`.
- **Fonts:** Playfair Display for headings, Inter for body text.

## Before launch

- **Contact details:** confirm the phone number **(747) 333-0034**, the email
  and the **business hours**. They came from the Burbank Chamber listing, and
  hours are placeholders. Staff can edit all of them in Admin → Settings.
- **Images:** replace `assets/brand/logo.png` and `assets/services/*.jpg` with
  high-resolution originals (same file names). These were cropped from the
  design mockups.
- **Chamber badge:** swap the typographic Chamber mark in
  `src/components/brand/sections.tsx` for the official member badge if
  desired.
- **Backend:** set up Supabase ([docs/BACKEND.md](docs/BACKEND.md)) and create
  the staff login with a strong password. The demo passwords in
  `src/config/demo.ts` only apply to the on-device demo.
